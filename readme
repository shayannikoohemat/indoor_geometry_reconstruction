in large public buildings (13742) which is (partly) financed by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO).
Authors would like to thank the Fire Brigade Rotterdam Rijnmond, Fire Brigade Haaksbergen, and TU Delft for making
their buildings available for the test and data collection. We acknowledge Claudio Mura (University of Zurich) for
